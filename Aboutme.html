									<p>During the last two years, I had the chance to take courses such as <u><i> Probabilities and statistics for Data Science,Fundamentals of Machine Learning,Advanced Data Mining,and Computer Vision</i></u> at IMT Atlantique, As my favourite programming languages turned out to be <b>SQL,Python and R</b>
									these courses allowed me to masterise powerful tools such as <b>TensorFlow or PyTorch </b> and must-have Python libraries such as <b> Pandas,Scikit-learn or open-CV </b> among others.</p>
